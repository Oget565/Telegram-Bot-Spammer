# Telegram-Bot-Spammer
A telegram bot that would spam you in the direct messages if there is a new message in a specific channel. Useful if you don't want to miss and important announcement.

Before running, please fill out the .env file

To start the bot on the server, I reccomend using docker-compose.yml, but you can do it any way you like.
